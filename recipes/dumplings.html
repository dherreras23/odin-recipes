    <h2>Homemade Dumplings</h2>

    <p>Dumplings are intimidating (well, they can be). But they also are,
         in fact, delicious. No matter what you stuff them with, the 
         concept of pillowy, soft dough encasing a luscious, super 
         flavorful filling is enough to warm you up from inside to out.</p>

    <p>Well, with our homemade dumpling recipe, we’re bringing that warm, 
        fuzzy feeling right to your very own kitchen table.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 cups red cabbage</li>
        <li>2 cups green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>½ lb shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the warm water and mix until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal parts.</li>
        <li>Roll out 1 piece of dough into a thin log and divide into 6 or 8 pieces, depending on the size of dumplings you want. Repeat with the remaining dough portion</li>
        <li>Lightly flour the dough pieces and roll out 1 piece into a thin circle roughly 4-inches (10 cm) in diameter.</li>
        <li>Keep the dumpling wrappers separated with a small piece of parchment paper and repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>To assemble the dumplings, add roughly 1 heaping tablespoon of filling to the center of a dumpling wrapper. With your finger, lightly coat half of the outside of the wrapper with water. Fold the moistened half of the wrapper over the filling and, using your fingers, pleat the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining fillings and wrappers.</li>
